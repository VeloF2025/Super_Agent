**Coordination Pattern**: Role-based pipeline execution
```python
# CrewAI pattern example  
crew = Crew(
    agents=[planner_agent, coder_agent, critic_agent],
    tasks=[planning_task, coding_task, review_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)
```

### 3. LangGraph
**Maturity**: Mature extension of LangChain ecosystem
**Best For**: Complex stateful workflows with dependency management

**Key Features**:
- Graph-based workflow orchestration
- Stateful multi-actor applications  
- Dependency graph execution
- Advanced logic handling with cycles and branching
- Robust state management across agent interactions

**Coordination Pattern**: Dependency graph-based workflows
```python
# LangGraph pattern example
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("researcher", research_agent)
workflow.add_node("analyzer", analysis_agent)  
workflow.add_edge("researcher", "analyzer")
```

### 4. OpenAI Swarm
**Maturity**: New but backed by OpenAI
**Best For**: Lightweight agent handoffs and conversation transfers

**Key Features**:
- Lightweight multi-agent orchestration
- Simple agent handoff mechanisms
- Scalable to millions of users
- Minimal overhead coordination
- Easy testing and management

**Coordination Pattern**: Agent handoff conversations
```python
# Swarm pattern example
def transfer_to_specialist(context):
    return specialist_agent

handoff_agent = Agent(
    name="Router",
    functions=[transfer_to_specialist]
)
```

### 5. LlamaIndex (Multi-Agent)
**Maturity**: Well-funded ($47M), enterprise adoption
**Best For**: Large-scale agent orchestration (100+ agents)

**Key Features**:
- Event-driven workflows at massive scale
- AgentWorkflow and llama-agents components
- 40+ community tools via LlamaHub
- Multi-modal data handling (PDFs, images)
- Enterprise adoption (Salesforce, KPMG)

**Coordination Pattern**: Event-driven massive scale orchestration

### 6. AgentFlow/Shakudo
**Maturity**: Production platform with enterprise focus  
**Best For**: Low-code enterprise deployment

**Key Features**:
- Low-code canvas for workflow design
- Wraps LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen
- Built-in security (VPC, RBAC)  
- 200+ turnkey connectors
- One-click deployment to clusters

**Coordination Pattern**: Visual workflow orchestration

- **Proven Results**: 90.2% performance improvement

### 2. Role-Based Specialization  
- **Best For**: Clear task separation
- **Examples**: PM → UX Designer → Developer → QA → DevOps
- **Framework**: CrewAI excels here

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Best For**: Scalable enterprise systems
- **Features**: Asynchronous coordination, fault tolerance
- **Frameworks**: AutoGen, LlamaIndex

### 4. Graph-Based Dependencies
- **Best For**: Complex workflows with branching logic
- **Features**: Conditional execution, parallel processing
- **Framework**: LangGraph specializes in this

### 5. Handoff Mechanisms
- **Best For**: Conversation management
- **Features**: Context preservation, smooth transitions  
- **Framework**: OpenAI Swarm

## Enterprise Considerations

### Security & Compliance
- **Self-hosted models** for sensitive data
- **Robust encryption** and access controls
- **RBAC integration** with existing systems
- **Audit trails** for all agent interactions

### Integration Requirements
- **API compatibility** with existing enterprise systems
- **Database connectivity** (SQL, vector stores)
- **Workflow integration** (CI/CD, project management)
- **Monitoring integration** (observability platforms)

### Scalability Factors
- **Agent limits**: Some frameworks handle 100+ agents
- **Resource management**: CPU, memory, token usage
