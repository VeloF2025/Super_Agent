        composite_score = self.calculate_composite_score(validation_results)
        
        if composite_score >= self.quality_standards['quality_score_minimum']:
            return QualityGateSuccess(deliverable, composite_score, validation_results)
        else:
            return QualityGateFailure(
                deliverable,
