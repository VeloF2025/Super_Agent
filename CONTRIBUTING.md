## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Super Agent system consists of:

- **11 Specialized Agents**: Each with unique capabilities and responsibilities
- **Orchestration Layer**: Jarvis OA coordinates all agents
- **Auto-Acceptance System**: Intelligent automation of routine tasks
- **Housekeeper Agent**: Automated file organization and cleanup
- **Dashboard**: React-based monitoring and control interface
- **ML Optimization**: Continuous learning and improvement

## 📁 File Organization Standards

### Directory Structure

Our housekeeper agent maintains strict file organization rules:

```
Super_Agent/
├── agents/                    # Agent-specific code and configs
│   └── agent-{specialty}/    # Individual agent directories
│       ├── CLAUDE.md         # Agent memory and context  
│       ├── sop/              # Standard Operating Procedures
│       ├── knowledge/        # Domain expertise
│       ├── learning/         # Continuous improvement
│       └── validation/       # Quality assurance
├── shared/                   # Common resources
│   ├── tools/               # Shared utilities
│   ├── communication/       # Inter-agent messaging
│   ├── memory/              # Collective learning
│   └── standards/           # Code and quality standards
├── docs/                    # Documentation
├── agent-dashboard/         # Monitoring interface
├── memory/                  # Context persistence
├── housekeeper/            # Automated maintenance
└── README.md               # Project overview
```

### File Naming Conventions

Follow these patterns for consistency:

#### Source Code
- **Python**: `snake_case.py`, `PascalCase.py` for classes
- **JavaScript**: `camelCase.js`, `PascalCase.tsx` for components
- **TypeScript**: `camelCase.ts`, `PascalCase.tsx` for components

#### Documentation
- **General**: `DESCRIPTIVE_NAME.md`
- **APIs**: `{service}_api.md`
- **SOPs**: `{topic}-sop.md`
- **Guides**: `{topic}-guide.md`

#### Configuration
- **Environment**: `{env}-config.yaml`
- **Agent**: `{agent}-config.json`
- **Service**: `{service}.config.{ext}`

### Housekeeper Integration

The housekeeper agent automatically:
- ✅ Organizes files according to content and purpose
- ✅ Maintains consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Cleans up temporary and redundant files
- ✅ Preserves all functional dependencies
- ✅ Creates proper directory structures

**Important**: The housekeeper will automatically organize your files, so focus on content rather than manual organization.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Agent-Specific Development

When working on a specific agent:

```bash
# Navigate to agent directory
cd agents/agent-{specialty}/

# Agent context is in CLAUDE.md
# Follow the agent's specific SOPs and standards
```

### 2. Shared System Development

For shared tools and utilities:

```bash
# Work in shared directories
cd shared/tools/     # For shared utilities
cd shared/standards/ # For standards and protocols
```

### 3. Dashboard Development

For UI/monitoring improvements:

```bash
cd agent-dashboard/
npm install
npm start  # Runs on localhost:3010
```

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Agent Testing
Each agent should have comprehensive validation:

```python
# agents/agent-{specialty}/validation/
def test_agent_functionality():
    """Test core agent capabilities"""
    pass

def test_integration():
    """Test agent integration with system"""
    pass
```

### System Testing
```bash
# Run full system tests
python shared/tools/multi_agent_initializer.py
# Verify all 11 agents initialize correctly
```

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Agent Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Complete agent memory and context
- **SOPs**: Detailed operational procedures
- **Knowledge**: Domain-specific information

### System Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Complete endpoint descriptions
- **Architecture Guides**: System design explanations
- **User Guides**: End-user instructions

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Repository Optimization
The housekeeper maintains deployment readiness:

- **Clean Structure**: Professional organization
- **Size Optimized**: ~500MB deployment vs 21GB+ development
- **No Sensitive Data**: Credentials and logs excluded
- **Fast Setup**: Quick clone and installation
