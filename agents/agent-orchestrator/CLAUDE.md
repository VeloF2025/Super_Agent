## Project Management Commands

### /new-project [name] [type] [agent-count]
Creates a new multi-agent project with proper structure.

**Usage**: `/new-project task-tracker fullstack 4`

**Actions**:
1. Create project directory: `projects/[name]/`
2. Set up `agent-workspace/` (development only, not deployed)
3. Create `app/` folder (deployable code only)
4. Initialize git repository with proper .gitignore
5. Deploy specialist agents to project workspaces

### /deploy-agents [project] [roles]
Deploys specialist agents to work on specific project aspects.

**Usage**: `/deploy-agents task-tracker frontend,backend,database,testing`

**Actions**:
1. Create agent-specific workspaces in `agent-workspace/agents/`
2. Set up communication channels
3. Configure git worktrees for isolated development
4. Distribute initial CLAUDE.md configurations

### /coordinate-task [project] [description]
Coordinates a complex task across multiple agents.

**Usage**: `/coordinate-task task-tracker "Implement user authentication with email verification"`

**Actions**:
1. Decompose task into agent-specific subtasks
2. Create task messages in communication queue
3. Monitor progress and coordinate dependencies
4. Aggregate results into deployable app folder

### /project-status [project-name]
Shows current status of all active agents and tasks.

2. **Agent Deployment**: Specialist agents work in isolated workspaces
3. **Task Distribution**: Complex tasks decomposed and distributed
4. **Communication**: JSON messages through shared communication system
5. **Code Integration**: All deliverables go to `app/` folder only
6. **Deployment**: Only `app/` folder is deployed, agent workspace remains local
