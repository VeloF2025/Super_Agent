# Suggestions Processing SOP - Housekeeper Agent

## Version Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Created**: 2025-07-20
- **Agent**: Housekeeper Agent (HOUSE-001)
- **Purpose**: Automated processing of enhancement suggestions and improvement ideas

---

## Overview

The Housekeeper Agent monitors the suggestions folder and automatically processes suggestion files through defined workflows. This ensures efficient handling of enhancement ideas while maintaining proper documentation and implementation tracking.

## Monitoring Scope

### Primary Monitor Directory
```
C:\Jarvis\Super Agent\suggestions\incoming\
```

### Processing Workflow Directories
- `suggestions/processing/` - Active review and implementation
- `suggestions/implemented/` - Successfully completed suggestions
- `suggestions/reviewed/` - Reviewed but not implemented
- `doc-dump/suggestions-archive/` - Long-term archive for outdated suggestions

## File Processing Workflow

### Stage 1: Detection and Initial Processing
**Trigger**: New file detected in `suggestions/incoming/`
**Timeline**: < 1 minute
**Actions**:
1. File validation and format verification
2. Content analysis for categorization
3. Priority and type detection
4. Initial security scan
5. Move to `suggestions/processing/`

### Stage 2: Content Analysis
**Location**: `suggestions/processing/`
**Timeline**: < 1 hour
**Actions**:
1. Technical feasibility assessment
2. Impact analysis on existing systems
3. Resource requirement estimation
4. Priority confirmation
5. Implementation planning

### Stage 3: Implementation Decision
**Timeline**: 24-48 hours
**Decision Points**:
- **Implement**: Move to implementation queue, notify relevant agents
- **Review Only**: Document analysis, move to `suggestions/reviewed/`
- **Archive**: Move to `doc-dump/suggestions-archive/` with reasoning

### Stage 4: Implementation Tracking
**For approved suggestions**:
1. Create implementation ticket
2. Assign to appropriate agent(s)
3. Monitor progress
4. Document completion
5. Move to `suggestions/implemented/`

## File Classification System

### Priority Detection
**Automatic analysis for**:
- Critical system issues
- High-impact enhancements
- Medium priority improvements
- Low priority nice-to-haves

**Indicators**:
- Keywords: "critical", "urgent", "bug", "security"
- Impact scope: system-wide vs. component-specific
- Performance implications
- User experience impact

### Type Classification
**Categories**:
- **Bug Fix**: Error corrections and issue resolutions
- **Enhancement**: Improvements to existing functionality
- **New Feature**: Additional capabilities or tools
- **Optimization**: Performance and efficiency improvements
- **Documentation**: Updates to guides, SOPs, or references

**Detection Patterns**:
- File content analysis
- Title parsing
- Structured format recognition
- Keywords and tags

## Processing Rules

### Automatic Processing (No Approval Required)
- Documentation updates and corrections
- Minor configuration improvements
- Non-breaking enhancements
- Optimization suggestions for non-critical systems
- File organization improvements

### OA Approval Required
- System architecture changes
- Cross-agent functionality modifications
- Security-related enhancements
- Performance modifications affecting multiple agents
- New agent capabilities or roles

### Human Approval Required
- Major system overhauls
- Security policy changes
- Budget or resource implications
- External integration modifications
- Compliance or regulatory impacts

## Content Analysis Procedures

### File Format Validation
```python
def validate_suggestion_file(filepath):
    required_sections = [
        "Priority", "Type", "Description", 
        "Expected Benefits", "Implementation Notes"
    ]
    
    content = read_file(filepath)
    validation_score = 0
    
    for section in required_sections:
        if section in content:
            validation_score += 1
    
    return validation_score / len(required_sections)
```

### Priority Assessment
```python
def assess_priority(content):
    priority_indicators = {
        "critical": ["critical", "urgent", "broken", "security"],
        "high": ["important", "significant", "performance"],
        "medium": ["improve", "enhance", "better"],
        "low": ["nice", "future", "consider"]
    }
    
    content_lower = content.lower()
    for priority, keywords in priority_indicators.items():
        if any(keyword in content_lower for keyword in keywords):
            return priority
    
    return "medium"  # default
```

### Implementation Complexity
```python
def assess_complexity(content, file_references):
    complexity_factors = {
        "simple": len(file_references) <= 2,
        "moderate": 2 < len(file_references) <= 5,
        "complex": 5 < len(file_references) <= 10,
        "major": len(file_references) > 10
    }
    
    return determine_complexity_level(complexity_factors)
```

## Integration with Agent System

### Orchestrator Agent Communication
**Automatic Notifications**:
- High priority suggestions detected
- Implementation decisions required
- Resource allocation requests
- Cross-agent coordination needs

**Approval Requests**:
```json
{
    "type": "suggestion_approval_request",
    "suggestion_id": "SUG-2025-07-20-001",
    "priority": "high",
    "complexity": "moderate",
    "affected_systems": ["agent-development", "shared-tools"],
    "estimated_effort": "2-3 hours",
    "implementation_plan": "...",
    "approval_required": "oa_approval"
}
```

### Agent Team Coordination
**Routing Logic**:
- Development suggestions → Development Team
- Documentation improvements → Communication Team
- Performance optimizations → Quality Team
- Research ideas → Research Team
- Architecture changes → Architect Agent

**Implementation Support**:
- Multi-agent collaboration for complex suggestions
- Progress tracking and coordination
- Resource allocation and scheduling
- Quality gates and validation

## Success Metrics and Reporting

### Processing Efficiency

### Daily Reporting
```json
{
    "date": "2025-07-20",
    "suggestions_processed": 5,
    "new_suggestions": 3,
    "implemented_today": 2,
    "pending_approval": 1,
    "average_processing_time": "45 minutes",
    "implementation_success_rate": "95%"
}
```

## File Organization Standards

### Naming Conventions
**Incoming Files**: User-defined (no restrictions)
**Processing Files**: `PROCESSING-[original-name]-[timestamp]`
**Completed Files**: `IMPLEMENTED-[original-name]-[completion-date]`
**Reviewed Files**: `REVIEWED-[original-name]-[review-date]`

### Metadata Tracking
Each processed file gets companion metadata:
```json
{
    "original_filename": "enhancement-idea.md",
    "processing_started": "2025-07-20T10:00:00",
    "priority": "medium",
    "type": "enhancement",
    "complexity": "moderate",
    "assigned_agents": ["agent-development"],
    "status": "in_progress",
    "implementation_notes": "...",
    "completion_date": null
}
```

## Safety and Recovery Procedures

### File Safety
- **No Deletion**: All suggestion files preserved indefinitely
- **Version Control**: Track all modifications and status changes
- **Backup**: Automatic backup of all suggestion processing
- **Recovery**: Complete restoration capability for any stage

### Error Handling
- **Processing Failures**: Automatic retry with escalation
- **Format Issues**: Human review trigger for malformed files
- **System Errors**: Graceful degradation with logging
- **Rollback**: Complete operation reversal capability

## Emergency Procedures

### System Overload
If suggestion volume exceeds processing capacity:
1. Prioritize critical and high-priority items
2. Queue lower priority suggestions
3. Request additional processing resources
4. Escalate to OA for resource allocation

### Processing Errors
For repeated processing failures:
1. Move problematic files to error queue
2. Generate detailed error reports
3. Request human intervention
4. Implement corrective measures
