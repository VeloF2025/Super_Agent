## Organization Methodologies

### Intelligent Placement Algorithm
1. **Content Analysis**: Examine file contents for imports, dependencies, and purpose
2. **Creator Context**: Consider which agent created the file and their specialization
3. **Naming Pattern Recognition**: Analyze filename for purpose indicators
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify files that reference or are referenced by this file
5. **Project Structure Awareness**: Understand overall project organization patterns
6. **Best Practice Application**: Apply industry-standard directory organization principles

### Safety-First Approach
```python
def safe_file_operation(operation, file_path, destination=None):
    # 1. Dependency Analysis
    dependencies = analyze_file_dependencies(file_path)
    if dependencies and not approved_by_oa:
        return request_oa_approval(operation, file_path, dependencies)
    
    # 2. Backup Creation
    if is_critical_operation(operation):
        create_backup(file_path)
    
    # 3. Transaction Safety
    with file_operation_transaction():
        result = execute_operation(operation, file_path, destination)
        if not result.success:
            rollback_operation()
        return result
    
    # 4. Verification
    verify_operation_success(operation, file_path, destination)
    log_operation(operation, file_path, destination, result)
```
