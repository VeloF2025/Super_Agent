# Suggestions Processing System

## Overview
This directory provides an automated system for managing enhancement suggestions and improvement ideas. The Housekeeper Agent monitors this folder and automatically processes files based on their status.

## Directory Structure

### 📁 incoming/
**Purpose**: Drop new suggestion files here  
**Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring by Housekeeper Agent  
**Auto-Processing**: Files automatically moved after initial review  

### 📁 processing/
**Purpose**: Suggestions currently being reviewed or implemented  
**Status**: Active work in progress  
**Duration**: Typically 1-7 days depending on complexity  

### 📁 implemented/
**Purpose**: Successfully implemented suggestions  
**Archive**: Permanent record of successful enhancements  
**Reference**: Available for future similar improvements  

### 📁 reviewed/
**Purpose**: Suggestions that have been reviewed but not implemented  
**Includes**: Ideas for future consideration, alternatives explored  
**Retention**: Indefinite for potential future implementation  

## How to Submit Suggestions

### 1. Create Suggestion File
Place your suggestion file in the `incoming/` directory with a descriptive name:
```
incoming/
├── enhancement-idea-YYYY-MM-DD.md
├── bug-fix-suggestion.md
├── new-feature-proposal.md
└── optimization-idea.md
```

### 2. File Format (Recommended)
```markdown
# Suggestion: [Title]

## Priority
- [ ] Critical
- [ ] High  
- [x] Medium
- [ ] Low

## Type
- [ ] Bug Fix
- [ ] Enhancement
- [x] New Feature
- [ ] Optimization
- [ ] Documentation

## Description
Clear description of the suggestion...

## Expected Benefits
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

## Implementation Notes
Any technical details or considerations...

## Related Files/Systems
List any files or systems that would be affected...
```

### 3. Automatic Processing
Once a file is placed in `incoming/`:
1. **Immediate**: Housekeeper Agent detects the file
2. **Within 1 hour**: File is reviewed and categorized
3. **Auto-move**: File moved to appropriate processing stage
4. **Notification**: Status updates logged and reported

## Processing Workflow

### Stage 1: Initial Review
- **Location**: `incoming/` → `processing/`
- **Duration**: < 1 hour
- **Actions**: File validation, categorization, priority assessment
- **Output**: Processing plan and timeline

### Stage 2: Implementation Review
- **Location**: `processing/`
- **Duration**: 1-7 days
- **Actions**: Technical feasibility, impact analysis, implementation planning
- **Decision Points**: Implement, defer, or archive

### Stage 3: Final Disposition
- **Implemented**: → `implemented/` with implementation log
- **Reviewed Only**: → `reviewed/` with analysis notes
- **Archive**: → `doc-dump/suggestions-archive/` if not actionable

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Real-Time Monitoring
The Housekeeper Agent continuously monitors:
- New files in `incoming/` (immediate processing)
- Files aging in `processing/` (escalation after 7 days)
- Implementation completion tracking

### Status Notifications
- **File Detection**: "New suggestion detected: [filename]"
- **Processing Start**: "Suggestion moved to processing: [title]"
- **Implementation**: "Suggestion implemented: [title] - see [location]"
- **Review Complete**: "Suggestion reviewed: [title] - archived in [location]"

## File Naming Conventions

### Incoming Files
```
enhancement-[topic]-YYYYMMDD.md
bugfix-[component]-YYYYMMDD.md
feature-[name]-YYYYMMDD.md
optimization-[area]-YYYYMMDD.md
```

### Processed Files
```
IMPLEMENTED-[original-name]-YYYYMMDD.md
REVIEWED-[original-name]-YYYYMMDD.md
```

## Integration with Agent System

### Housekeeper Agent Responsibilities
1. **File Monitoring**: Real-time detection of new suggestions
2. **Initial Processing**: Content analysis and categorization
3. **Workflow Management**: Moving files through processing stages
4. **Status Tracking**: Maintaining processing history and metrics
5. **Cleanup**: Archiving completed or outdated suggestions

### Orchestrator Agent Integration
- **High Priority Suggestions**: Automatic escalation to OA
