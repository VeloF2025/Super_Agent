Your approach is excellent! Operating from Cursor in an agents folder with a clear separation between agent infrastructure and deployable code is a smart architectural decision. Let me provide a comprehensive implementation strategy for this setup.

Implementation Guide
1. Set Up the Orchestrator Agent
Create this in your agents/orchestrator/ directory:Orchestrator CLAUDE.mdDocument # Orchestrator Agent Configuration

You are the Orchestrator Agent responsible for managing multi-agent development projects.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Create project directory structure
   - Set up agent workspace2. Create the Agent Manager Script
This script helps you manage agents and projects from your Cursor workspace:Agent Manager ScriptCode #!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Agent Manager - Orchestrates multi-agent development projects
Run this from the agents/ directory in Cursor
"""

import os
import json
import subprocess
import shutil
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime
i3. Workflow Example
Here's how you would use this setup:Multi-Agent Workflow ExampleDocument # Multi-Agent Development Workflow

## Initial Setup (One Time)

1. **Position yourself in Cursor**
   ```bash
   cd ~/workspace/agents
   ```

2. **Make the agent manager executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x agent-manager.py
   ```

## Creating a New4. Setting Up Inter-Agent Communication
Create a simple communication handler that agents can use:Simple Agent MessengerCode #!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Simple messaging system for agents
Place this in each agent's workspace
"""

class SimpleMessenger:
    def __init__(self, agent_id=NKey Advantages of This Approach

Clean Separation: Agent infrastructure never mixes with deployable code
Easy Deployment: Just deploy the app/ folder - no agent artifacts
Scalability: Add more agents or projects without restructuring
Debugging: All agent activity is logged in agent-workspace/
Flexibility: Each project can have different agent configurations

Recommended Workflow

Start in Cursor in your agents/ directory
Use the Orchestrator Agent to create projects: "Create a new e-commerce platform"
Agents work in isolation in their git worktrees
Communication flows through the shared directories
Clean code accumulates in the app/ folder
Deploy only the app - agent workspace stays local

Tips for Success

Let the Orchestrator coordinate - Don't manually manage individual agents
Use clear task descriptions - The better the description, the better the decomposition
Monitor the communication queue - Watch for stuck messages
Regular status checks - Use ./agent-manager.py status frequently
Clean up completed projects - Remove agent workspaces after deployment

This structure gives you the best of both worlds: sophisticated multi-agent development capabilities with clean, deployable output. The agents handle the complexity while your deployed app remains simple and production-ready.
