## 🔄 **Automatic Operations**

The housekeeper runs automatically and:

- **Every 5 minutes**: Checks for new OA instructions
- **Immediately**: Processes any manual requests from OA

## 📁 **Default Cleanup Rules**

| Location | Retention | Action |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `context-inbox/processed/` | 7 days | Move to `context-inbox/archive/` |
| `suggestions/incoming/` | 1 day | Move to `suggestions/processed/` |
| `temp/` | 1 day | Delete permanently |
| `*.tmp, *.temp` files | Immediate | Delete on sight |
