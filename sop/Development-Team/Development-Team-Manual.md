## Development Methodologies

### Agile Development Process

#### **Sprint Planning**
```python
def plan_development_sprint(requirements, team_capacity):
    # 1. Break down requirements into user stories
    user_stories = decompose_requirements(requirements)
    
    # 2. Estimate story points and complexity
    for story in user_stories:
        story.effort_estimate = estimate_effort(story)
        story.complexity = assess_complexity(story)
        story.dependencies = identify_dependencies(story)
    
    # 3. Prioritize based on business value and dependencies
    prioritized_stories = prioritize_stories(user_stories)
    
    # 4. Assign to specialists based on expertise
    assignments = assign_to_specialists(prioritized_stories, team_capacity)
    
    # 5. Create sprint backlog with timeline
    sprint_backlog = create_sprint_backlog(assignments)
    
    return sprint_backlog
```
