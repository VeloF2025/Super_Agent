## Research Methodologies

### Information Gathering Process

#### 1. **Research Planning Phase**
```python
def plan_research(request):
    # 1. Analyze request scope and requirements
    scope_analysis = analyze_research_scope(request)
    
    # 2. Identify optimal research methods
    methods = select_research_methods(scope_analysis)
    
    # 3. Assign specialists based on requirements
    assignments = assign_specialists(methods, scope_analysis)
    
    # 4. Define success criteria and timelines
    success_criteria = define_success_metrics(request)
    
    return ResearchPlan(assignments, methods, success_criteria)
```

#### 2. **Information Collection Phase**
```python
def collect_information(research_plan):
    findings = []
    
    for assignment in research_plan.assignments:
        specialist_findings = assignment.specialist.research(
            assignment.scope,
            assignment.methods
        )
        
        # Validate findings quality
        validation_result = validate_findings(specialist_findings)
        if validation_result.passed:
            findings.append(specialist_findings)
        else:
            # Request additional research or clarification
            enhanced_findings = request_enhancement(
                assignment.specialist,
                specialist_findings,
                validation_result.issues
            )
            findings.append(enhanced_findings)
    
    return findings
```

#### 3. **Analysis & Synthesis Phase**
```python
def synthesize_findings(findings, original_request):
    # 1. Cross-reference findings for consistency
    consistency_check = cross_validate_findings(findings)
    
    # 2. Identify patterns and insights
    patterns = identify_patterns(findings)
    insights = extract_insights(patterns, original_request)
    
    # 3. Resolve conflicts and discrepancies
    if consistency_check.has_conflicts:
        resolved_findings = resolve_conflicts(findings, consistency_check)
    else:
        resolved_findings = findings
    
    # 4. Generate actionable recommendations
    recommendations = generate_recommendations(
        resolved_findings,
        insights,
        original_request
    )
    
    return ResearchOutput(resolved_findings, insights, recommendations)
```

        # Layer 1: Completeness Check
        completeness = self.check_completeness(output)
        validation_results.append(completeness)
        
        # Layer 2: Accuracy Verification
        accuracy = self.verify_accuracy(output)
        validation_results.append(accuracy)
        
        # Layer 3: Source Quality Assessment
        source_quality = self.assess_source_quality(output)
        validation_results.append(source_quality)
        
        # Layer 4: Consistency Analysis
        consistency = self.analyze_consistency(output)
        validation_results.append(consistency)
        
        # Layer 5: Actionability Review
        actionability = self.review_actionability(output)

        'finding_accuracy': verify_finding_accuracy(research_output.findings),
        'completeness': measure_completeness(research_output, original_request),
        'actionability': assess_actionability(research_output.recommendations),
        'timeliness': measure_timeliness(research_output.delivery_time)
    }
    
    # Weighted average
    weights = {
        'source_credibility': 0.25,
        'finding_accuracy': 0.25,
        'completeness': 0.20,
        'actionability': 0.20,
        'timeliness': 0.10
