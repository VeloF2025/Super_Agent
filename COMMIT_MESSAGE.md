# feat: Add comprehensive security and development improvements to Super Agent system

## Summary
Major security and infrastructure overhaul transforming the Super Agent system from prototype to production-ready platform with enterprise-grade security, testing, and deployment capabilities.

## Security Enhancements
- Add JWT-based authentication system with user management
- Implement HTTPS/TLS encryption support with auto-cert generation
- Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization middleware
- Create security audit tool for vulnerability scanning
- Implement rate limiting and security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Add secure environment configuration with auto-generated secrets

## Testing Infrastructure
- Set up Jest testing framework with ES modules support
- Create comprehensive test suites for core services
- Add test coverage tracking with 80% thresholds
- Implement test utilities and fixtures

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Add GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing
- Configure daily security scanning with CodeQL and Semgrep
- Set up automated dependency updates with Dependabot
- Implement multi-stage deployment pipeline

## Error Handling & Validation
- Add centralized error handling middleware
- Create custom error classes for different scenarios
- Implement comprehensive input validation rules
- Add request ID tracking and audit logging

## Developer Experience
- Create diagnostic tools for pre-push validation
- Add HTTPS setup scripts for Windows and Linux
- Write comprehensive migration guide
- Update documentation with security best practices

## Breaking Changes
- Dashboard now requires authentication (see SECURITY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- WebSocket connections require token authentication
- All API endpoints protected by JWT auth

## Files Added
- agent-dashboard/server/middleware/security.js
- agent-dashboard/server/middleware/errorHandler.js
- agent-dashboard/server/middleware/validation.js
- agent-dashboard/server/services/auth.js
- agent-dashboard/server/routes/auth.js
- agent-dashboard/server/index-secure.js
- config/environment.js
- security-audit.js
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- .github/workflows/security.yml
- .github/dependabot.yml
- Multiple test files and documentation

## Notes
- Default admin credentials auto-generated on first run
- Check ADMIN_CREDENTIALS.txt and change password immediately
- Run `npm install` in agent-dashboard before starting
- Use `npm run start:secure` for the enhanced server
