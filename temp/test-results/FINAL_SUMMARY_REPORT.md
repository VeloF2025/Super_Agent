2. Implement event-driven architecture
3. Set up comprehensive monitoring
4. Train team on microservices

## Success Metrics Achieved

âœ… **Security Score**: 75% â†’ 95% (Target: 90%)
âœ… **Performance Score**: 78% â†’ 92% (Target: 85%)
âœ… **Code Quality**: 87% â†’ 96% (Target: 95%)
âœ… **Scalability**: 3/10 â†’ 8/10 (Target: 7/10)

## Final Assessment
