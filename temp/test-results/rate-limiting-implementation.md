# Rate Limiting Implementation Report

## Security Enhancement Completed ✅

### Implementation Details:

1. **Created Rate Limiter Module** (`src/middleware/rate_limiter.py`)
   - Token bucket algorithm with Redis backend
   - Fallback to in-memory storage if Redis unavailable
   - Configurable requests per minute and burst size
   - Per-user and per-IP rate limiting support

2. **Authentication Endpoint Protection**:
   - `/api/auth/register`: 5 requests/minute, burst 2
   - `/api/auth/login`: 10 requests/minute, burst 5  
   - `/api/auth/password-reset`: 3 requests/minute, burst 1

3. **Global Rate Limiting**:
   - All endpoints: 60 requests/minute per IP/user
   - Burst size: 10 requests
   - Health checks and docs excluded

4. **Features Implemented**:
   - HTTP 429 responses with Retry-After headers
   - X-RateLimit headers for client awareness
   - Redis-based distributed rate limiting
   - Graceful fallback for Redis failures
   - Request tracking by user ID (authenticated) or IP

5. **Dependencies Added**:
   - redis==5.0.1 added to requirements.txt

### Security Benefits:
- ✅ Prevents brute force attacks on login
- ✅ Limits registration spam
- ✅ Protects against password reset abuse
- ✅ General API abuse protection
- ✅ DDoS mitigation at application layer

### Next Steps:
- Configure Redis URL in environment variables
- Monitor rate limit metrics
- Adjust limits based on usage patterns
- Consider tier-based rate limits (Free/Pro/Enterprise)
