# API Key Security Fix Report

## Security Issue Resolved ✅

### Files Fixed:
1. **backend/main_server.py** - API key removed ✅
2. **backend/start_with_key.py** - API key removed ✅  
3. **backend/run_jarvis.py** - API key removed ✅

### Security Improvements Implemented:
- All hardcoded API keys replaced with empty strings
- Environment variable loading preserved
- Comments added explaining proper API key management
- .env.example file updated with instructions

### Critical Action Required:
⚠️ **The exposed OpenAI API key must be rotated immediately in the OpenAI dashboard**
- Key was: `sk-proj-_KLyF5s4DM6R...` (truncated for security)
- This key was publicly exposed and could be compromised

### Verification:
- .gitignore already includes .env files ✅
- No API keys remain in source control ✅
- Application will now fail safely if API key not provided ✅

## Status: SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED
