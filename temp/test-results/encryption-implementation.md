# Encryption at Rest Implementation Report

## Security Enhancement Completed âœ…

### Implementation Details:

1. **Created Encryption Module** (`src/utils/encryption.py`)
   - AES-256 encryption using Fernet
   - Master key management via environment variables
   - Field-level encryption/decryption
   - Password encryption with PBKDF2

2. **Implemented Secure Storage**
   - Email credentials encrypted in storage
   - User sensitive fields encrypted (phone, SSN, payment details)
   - Automatic encryption/decryption on read/write
   - Deep copy to prevent accidental exposure

3. **Created User Service** (`src/services/user_service.py`)
   - Secure user profile management
   - GDPR compliance (data export/deletion)
   - Encrypted field handling
   - Redis caching with TTL

4. **Security Configuration** (`src/core/security.py`)
   - Centralized security settings
   - Password strength validation
   - Input sanitization
   - CSRF token generation
   - Secure headers configuration

### Encrypted Fields:
- Email passwords and OAuth tokens
- User phone numbers
- Payment details
- Personal notes
- Addresses
- SSN/Tax IDs
- API keys

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=<base64-encoded-fernet-key>
```

### Security Features:
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100k iterations)
- Automatic key rotation capability
- Secure token generation
- Data masking for logs

### Next Steps:
- Implement key rotation schedule
- Add encryption version tracking
- Set up audit logging for sensitive operations
